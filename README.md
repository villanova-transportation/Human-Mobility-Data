# Human Mobility Data Hub
The human mobility data repository is a knowledge transfer hub for the INFORM-AFICA pilot project collaborators. 
Data user guides and South Africa & Nigeria Datasets (human mobility metrics and public health) have been included. 
The knowledge transfer between the INFORM-AFRICA team and Villanova graduate transportation engineering research group will improve the understanding of modeling personal trips data, geospatial analysis, and the influence of mobility on epidemiology & public health.
