# Human Mobility Data Hub
This human mobility data repository is for the INFORM-Africa team members and collaborators. 
Data dictionaries and South Africa & Nigeria Datasets (human mobility metrics and public health) have been included. 
The knowledge transfer between the INFORM-Africa team and Villanova University Nova-Mobility Lab will improve the understanding of modeling personal trips data, geospatial analysis, and the influence of mobility on epidemiology & public health. 
## Human activity in South Africa
This is a density plot of 14 days of human activity in South Africa. It's visualized by plotting location-based service data on the map.

## Daily trip metrics of Nigeria
Trip metrics in the figure are calculated by aggregating the trip attributes at the Nigeria national level and cover the period 01 January to 25 April 2020, demonstrating the overall mobility changes in Nigeria at the beginning of the pandemic. Trips are identified by a calibrated recursive algorithm (Details can be found in the paper: https://sajs.co.za/article/view/14727). Trip attributes such as origin, destination, start time, end time, distance, etc., were recorded.

## Daily trip metrics of Nigeria by wealth group
Visualise the human mobility trends in percentage changes when compared with the January average. The statistics are reported for three different groups of states in Nigeria. The grouping was based on the groupsâ€™ relative wealth according to RWI percentile rankings. Two thresholds for RWI (i.e. 0.33 and 0.66) were selected to divide the states into three groups of equal sample sizes. More details can be found in the paper: https://sajs.co.za/article/view/14727
