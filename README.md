# INFORM-AFRICA-Training

The INFORM-AFRICA-Training repository is a hub for knowledge transfer for INFORM-AFICA pilot project collaborators. 
Data User guides, South Africa & Nigeria Datasets (public health, individual level trips, and weather) have been included. 
The knowledge tranfer between the INFORM-AFRICA team and Villanova graduate transportation research group will improve the understanding of
modeling personal trips data, geospatial analysis, and the influence of mobility on epidemiology & public health.
